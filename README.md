> PluginBase is a collection of useful classes for Bukkit and Spigot plugins.

> PluginBase is the framework for all of ExtendedAlpha's orignal plugins such as InFamousPermissions and BlockPhysics. This may not include forks of plugins that our team has changed / enhanced but may be added if we feel the need and if the licenses work together.

> Note if you plan to use this framework you must credit us. Also this plugin should be shaded into your plugin using maven shade plugin it does not support being ran as a bukkit plugin.
